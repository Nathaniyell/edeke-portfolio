                Research & Discovery

            </h2>
            <p>To address the needs of a broad user base, I categorized my research into three key generational
                segments: Gen Z, Gen Y (Millennials), and Gen X. Each generation has different financial behaviors and
                needs, which influenced the design approach</p>
            <ol class="flex flex-col gap-4 list-decimal list-inside">
                <li>Gen Z (Born 1997–2012)
                    Tech-savvy and mobile-first, Gen Z users expect fast, seamless transactions and AI-driven
                    interactions. They are more likely to experiment with financial tools like cryptocurrency and
                    digital wallets.
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside my-2">
                        <li> Key Insight: Gen Z prefers clean, modern interfaces with minimal friction. They respond
                            well to interactive elements like AI chatbots and are interested in financial education that
                            incorporates gamification.</li>
                    </ul>

                </li>
                <li>Gen Y / Millennials (Born 1981–1996)
                    Millennials value convenience and prefer apps that allow them to manage their money on the go, with
                    emphasis on budgeting tools and investment options.

                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside my-2">
                        <li> Key Insight: They are highly interested in investment and savings tools, and they seek
                            financial advice to plan for long-term goals like homeownership. Clear navigation and data
                            visualization are key to engaging them.</li>
                    </ul>

                </li>
                <li>Gen X (Born 1965–1980)
                    Gen X prefers more traditional banking tools but is increasingly embracing digital financial
                    platforms. They value security and detailed information before making financial decisions.


                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside my-2">
                        <li> Key Insight: Gen X users tend to need more detailed guidance, especially with loans and
                            investment tools. They also prefer in-depth educational content over quick tips, focusing on
                            long-term financial planning.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                </li>
                <li>Competitive Analysis: I studied existing fintech apps like Revolut, Chime, and N26 to understand
                    their strengths and identify areas for improvement in my design, considering the preferences of each
                    generational segment.

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside flex flex-col space-y-2">
                <li>A Gen Z student who wants fast, reliable transactions and AI-driven financial advice.</li>

                <p>During the research phase, I developed empathy maps for each user persona—Gen Z, Millennials, and Gen
                    X—based on their interactions with Nigerian fintech apps like Kuda, OPay, and PiggyVest. These maps
                    captured insights into users' thoughts, emotions, and behaviors, highlighting key pain points and
                    desires, such as Gen Z’s need for fast, gamified experiences, Millennials’ focus on savings and
                    investments, and Gen X’s demand for trust and clarity.
                    The full empathy maps for each persona group can be viewed via the link attached below.</p>

                    <p>Creating a clear and effective information architecture (IA) was a core part of the design
                        process to ensure users could navigate the app’s features with ease. The IA was designed to
                        prioritize accessibility and reduce friction, based on generational needs.</p>
                    <p>The IA was organized as follows:</p>

                        </li>
                        <li> Savings & Investment: A section for users to set savings goals, view investment options,

                        </li>

                Font Selection
            </h2>
            <p>
                For the typography, I chose Poppins as the primary font for its modern, clean, and geometric appearance.
                Here's why:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                <li>
                    Legibility: As a fintech app, clarity is crucial for financial transactions, and Poppins offers
                    great readability across various screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.</li>
                <li>
                    Aesthetic Balance: Poppins balances both professionalism and approachability, which is important for
                    creating trust in financial products. Its rounded letterforms give a friendly feel without
                    compromising on a sense of security.</li>
                <li>
                    Versatility: With multiple weight variants (light, regular, bold), Poppins allowed me to create
                    visual hierarchy. For example, Bold was used for headings like "Send Money" or "Your Balance", while
                    Regular kept body text easy on the eyes. The Light variant softened secondary details, contributing
                    to a clean, uncluttered look.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="font-bold text-xl">
                Color Scheme
            </h2>
            <p class="font-semibold">Primary Color: #008080 (Teal)</p>
            <p>I chose teal as the primary color to reflect stability, trust, and clarity, which are key attributes
                users seek in financial apps. The color has an interesting psychological appeal:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                <li>
                    Trust & Dependability: Teal, a blend of blue and green, combines the calming effect of blue (which
                    signifies trust, professionalism) and the balance of green (associated with money, growth, and
                    prosperity). This choice conveys that users can rely on SmartFunds to manage their finances securely
                    and confidently.</li>
                <li>
                    Approachability: Teal stands out but is not overwhelming. It offers a modern, refreshing feel that
                    differs from the more corporate tones of blue used by traditional banks, creating a welcoming,
                    human-centered experience.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="!mt-4">
                <p class="font-semibold">Accent Color: #FF4500 (OrangeRed)</p>
                <p>The accent color, a vibrant OrangeRed, was selected for specific interactive elements and CTAs
                    (call-to-actions) like “Send” and “Pay Now.” <br> Here’s why this color works well:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                    <li>
                        Urgency & Energy: OrangeRed is energetic and draws attention without being harsh. It evokes
                        urgency but remains warm and friendly, making users feel motivated to complete tasks without
                        feeling pressured.</li>
                    <li>
                        Contrast: The orange-red against teal creates a strong contrast that naturally guides users to
                        key actions. This visual hierarchy ensures users immediately notice what they need to do next,
                        minimizing confusion or hesitation.
