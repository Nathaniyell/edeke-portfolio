        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Project Overview</h2>
        <p>T30 is a non-denominational Christian platform with daily devotionals and collective prayer times designed to
          help you build a consistent devotional life. Since its debut in 2020, T30's user base has grown into
          thousands, allowing people from all over the world to connect, pray and read the word daily.</p>

        <p class="italic font-semibold">Just a heads-up: I'm not part of T30, and the opinions in this case study are
          all mine. Unlike the T30 designers, I don't have complete access to the user data that shaped their current
          design, the font type, images and the specific elements they used for their design. So, this case study isn't
          all-encompassing, and I'm not proposing T30 should switch to my redesign.</p>
      </section>
      <div>
        <p class="font-semibold !mb-4">

          My goals for the redesign:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-4 md:ml-6 space-y-3 flex flex-col">
          <li>To facilitate a more engaging and seamless experience when it comes to devotion and staying connected</li>
          <li>To design a more personable and intuitive user interface</li>
          <li>To design through user empathy (HCD)</li>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>While the current app design serves its purpose, it lacks key elements that could significantly enhance user
          engagement and community interaction. Users have expressed a desire for features such as testimonials, a
          community space, a journaling platform, and bookmark functionality, and a voice reader functionality to enrich
          their experience. To create a more vibrant and user-friendly platform, the redesign aims to seamlessly
          integrate these components, fostering a stronger sense of community and personal connection for believers.</p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Target Audience Demographics </h2>
        <p>Among the 10 T30 users I interviewed, there were 4 males and 6 females. The age of the male users ranged from
          25 to 31 years old, while the female users ranged from 22 to 30 years old. 90% are working class.</p>
        <p>To make this even more interesting, 30% of the users I interviewed ranked T30 in their Top 3 Most Used
          Application. Additionally, 50% of the people sampled uses T30 everyday.</p>
        <p class="font-semibold">And the fun goes on </p>
        <p>I asked the 10 T30 users I interviewed, <em> What motivates you to use T30 regularly, and can you share
            specific aspects that contribute to a positive engagement experience?</em></p>
        <p>I collected a total of <span class="font-semibold"> 30 adjectives.</span> <br> The top 3 adjectives were:

Through sharing personal stories, it offers motivation, serves as a beacon of hope, and spreads the uplifting spirit of faith.

        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Feature #2: Community of Believers</h2>
        <p>After thorough user research, a notable finding surfaced: 20% of our users voiced a keen interest in having a community hub within the app. Understanding the value of nurturing connections and communal interactions among believers, we introduced the 'Community' feature. This fresh inclusion transcends traditional testimonials, establishing an interactive platform where users can share personal narratives, participate in enriching conversations, offer mutual support, and collectively enhance their faith journey.</p>
        <p>Following our user research, a common sentiment emerged among our users: they desired a space within the app where they could connect with fellow believers and share their experiences, insights, and support. One user expressed this desire, stating, "I love T30 for its daily devotionals, but having a community space within the app would be amazing. Connecting with fellow believers could make the experience even richer, allowing us to share insights and support each other on our faith journeys." In this section, we'll delve into how I made my design decisions, while prioritizing the needs of my end users </p>

      <p class="text-center italic">A picture of some sketches</p>
        </div>
        <p>During the brainstorming phase, I strategically considered the optimal placement for integrating the community feature, ensuring its immediate visibility. After careful deliberation, I concluded that the most effective approach was to substitute the 'Give' icon with the 'Community' icon. To streamline the interface and prevent overcrowding, I introduced the hamburger menu, thereby replacing the profile icon. This modification not only accommodated the inclusion of both the profile and give features but also alleviated clutter, creating additional space for the integration of other features under the 'More' section.
        </p>
        <p>I thought of having the T30 team create the communities instead of letting users do it. This way, we prevent the app from having too many or irrelevant groups. Users can easily join any community of their choice without the hassle of navigating through numerous options</p>
